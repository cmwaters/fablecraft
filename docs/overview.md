# Overview

Fablecraft is, at its core, a text editor. However, not like any other editor, it is designed as a tool with the purpose of synthesizing as close as possible to how our brains think creatively. Put as a question, Fablecraft asks what is the best interface we can provide our mind for extracting our own creative (and writeable) thoughts. This reflects the main feature of the text editor which formats itself not like a linear page where we are induced into writing in the same sequence with which a reader reads, although still important and incorporated in the text editor, but rather a tree or a graph which accommodates a single or few grains of ideas as roots of the tree and allows the user to expand and branch out, exploring alternatives, understanding the texts own development arc, providing the agility to change, and finally reaching a rich degree of detail for the reader to understand and enjoy.
